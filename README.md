# Streaming-Revenue-Calculator

This JavaScript program was created for my AP Computer Science Principles class.  
It calculates monthly and total revenue for a streaming service using active viewer data, a membership percentage, and a monthly fee.

## Features

- Stores viewer data from January to June in an array
- Calculates monthly memberships based on user-entered percentage
- Uses functions to:
  - Calculate monthly membership count
  - Calculate monthly revenue
  - Calculate total revenue
- Outputs detailed results using arrays

## Purpose

This project helped me practice using **arrays**, **functions**, **loops**, and **data-based calculations** in JavaScript.
